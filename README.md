# ‚ö° AZOR Flashing

AZOR Flashing is a Python-native solution to a faulty printed-circuit board flashing station on the AZOR assembly line at Marquardt U.S.. This station is responsible for more than $3,000,000 in product and provides the functionality to flash, download, and run application code, pair key fob and gateway boards with unique hex values, and crystal trim board headers to optimize bluetooth frequency strength. 

Using Python multithreading and hardware optimization for quick JTAG connections, this rebuild reflects a significant improvement in efficiency over the previous station, cutting down production time by 89% while utilizing a less resource intensive setup. 

A responsive and functional GUI accompanies the Python automation, providing clear status indicators and live instructions to allow for efficient use by untrained operators. This, alongside detailed process checks, ensures a favorable fallout rate of less than 1%.

# üèéÔ∏è Performance

### Average Cycle Time
- Current: `1m 02s`
- Original: `4m 33s`
  
### Fallout Rate
- Current: `<1%`
- Original: `>50%`

_These improvements reflect savings of over 4,000 labor hours and $100,000 in related costs over the project's lifetime._ 

# üñ•Ô∏è Where is the Code?
This application was developed for sole use by Marquardt U.S. and is therefore not available for open source or public use as per my employment agreement.

This README file simply serves to provide a detailed depiction of my contribution to the project during my time as a Software Engineer at Marquardt.
